= Eclipse Dart Language Server Implementation

== Setup

Currently this plugin requires to have the dart_language_server (https://github.com/natebosch/dart_language_server) globally installed via pub.
Also the file src/com/vogella/lsp/flutter/FlutterLanguageServerStreamProvider.java has it hardcoded to my home directory. 
Change this after installation to wherever your pub global packages are.
