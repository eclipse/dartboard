= Eclipse Dart Language Server Implementation

== Setup

The language server binary is bundled in the /language_server/bin/dart_language_server.dart.snapshot.
Currently there is still the need to have dart globally installed to run this. Also the path where it has to be is /usr/lib/dart/bin/dart. 

== TODO
- Also bundle the dart executable or pull it from.. ? 
	Resources: https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/archive
	Problem: The file is 117 MB big. Which is a lot.
